/**
 * Draws one ship from a camera of the caller's choosing, into whatever framebuffer is bound.
 *
 * <p>For anything that wants a ship as a picture rather than as part of the world: a monitor showing
 * the ship it is bolted to, a map, an icon. Everything else that draws a ship does so from the
 * world's one camera and has nowhere to put a second — the vanilla path goes through Minecraft's
 * chunk renderer and the Sodium path through Sodium's, and neither takes a camera as an argument.
 *
 * <p>So this does not go through a world renderer at all. It draws {@link ShipMeshCache}'s vertex
 * buffers, which are compiled from blocks and know nothing about how the world around them is being
 * drawn. That is the reason one implementation serves all three backends rather than three serving
 * one each, and the reason a ship the world is drawing through Sodium can still be drawn here.
 *
 * <p>A ship the batched renderer is already drawing is not meshed twice — the cache is shared, and
 * the portrait pins it so that switching a ship's renderer away from batched does not pull the
 * geometry out from under a monitor still showing it.
 *
 * <p>Drawn with the ordinary chunk shaders rather than the batched ones. Those want a ship transform
 * texture, the dynamic light storage, an emitter list and a render origin, all of which exist to put
 * a ship in the right place in a world; a portrait is not in a world, and what is wanted from it is
 * the geometry.
